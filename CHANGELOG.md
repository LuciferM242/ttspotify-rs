# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-10
### Added
- YouTube seek in both directions with accurate live position tracking.
- `replay` command to restart the current track.
- Startup log line reporting the app, TeamTalk SDK, yt-dlp, and bgutil-pot versions.
- Config validation on load (clamps volume, ports, and other out-of-range fields).
- Crash log: panics are written to `logs/panics.log` even when the tray has no console.

### Changed
- YouTube playback buffers the full track, making seek instant in both directions.
- Reconnect hardened: a watchdog recovers instead of spinning forever, the bot
  rejoins the correct channel, and the tray retries with backoff.
- The current channel is remembered across an `rs` restart (config default is untouched).
- Runtime config writes go through a single atomic writer (no more clobbering).
- Config directory resolves next to the executable on Windows.
- Slimmer build: a single TLS stack (rustls) instead of two, and the unused speaker
  backend removed.
- Updated the TeamTalk SDK integration (password now zeroized in memory / redacted in logs).
- Audio hot-path optimizations.

### Fixed
- End-of-queue no longer leaves the status stuck on "Playing".
- Fixed a YouTube double queue-advance race on track end.
- `sblah` no longer performs a seek; `queue rm <non-number>` shows usage; volume is clamped.
- Track-start failures are reported to the requester and auto-skipped.

### Removed
- Unused audio decoders and the unused local-speaker playback backend.

### Security
- Downloaded yt-dlp and bgutil-pot binaries are verified (SHA-256) before they are executed.

## [0.1.0]
- Initial release.
